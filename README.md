## Changelog

### üÜï v0.9 - WIP
  - Moved `Dialog.tscn` to the root of the addon so it is easier to find.
  - New tool: Glossary Editor
  - New default asset: Glossary Font
  - Theme Editor:
    - Added new options to customize the glossary popup (still not working)
  - Timeline Editor:
    - Added categories for the events.
    - New `Emit Signal` event. This event will make the Dialog node emit a signal called `dialogic_signal`. You can connect this in a moment of your timeline with other scripts.
    - New `Change Scene` event. You can change the current Scene to whatever `.tscn` you pick. This will happen instantly, but in the future I'll add some transition effects so it is not that abrupt.
    - New `Wait Seconds` event. This will hide the dialog and wait X seconds until continuing with the rest of the timeline. 
    - Re-adding the `End Branch` event.
  - New `Dialogic` class. With this new class you can add dialogs from code easily:
    ```
    var new_dialog = Dialogic.start('Your Timeline Name Here')
    add_child(new_dialog)
    ```
    To connect signals you can also do:
    ```
    func _ready():
        var new_dialog = Dialogic.start('Your Timeline Name Here')
        add_child(new_dialog)
        new_dialog.connect("dialogic_signal", self, 'signal_from_dialogic')

    func signal_from_dialogic(value):
        print(value)
    ```

  - Bug fixes:
    - Fixing an error when having an empty join event in a timeline.

## FAQ 
### üî∑ How can I install Dialogic?
To install a Dialogic, download it as a ZIP archive. All releases are listed here: https://github.com/coppolaemilio/dialogic/releases. Then extract the ZIP archive and move the `addons/` folder it contains into your project folder.

If you want to know more you can read the [official documentation page](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html).

### üî∑ Can I use Dialogic in one of my projects?
Yes, you can use Dialogic to make any kind of game (even commercial ones). The project is developed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/coppolaemilio/dialogic/blob/master/LICENSE).


### üî∑ Why are the dialogs are not working when exporting my project?
When you export a project using Dialogic, you need to add `*.json` on the Resources tab (see the image below) and also make sure to copy the `dialogic` folder to the same place where the executable of your game is (again, see bottom right side of the image).
